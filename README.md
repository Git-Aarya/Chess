# Chess Game in Python

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a fully functional chess game in Python, offering both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI) for players to choose from. The game will support two-player mode, allowing users to play against each other on the same machine. Features include standard chess rules, move validation, check and checkmate detection, and a simple AI for future versions.

## Features
- **Two-Player Mode:** Play chess with a friend on the same computer.
- **Graphical User Interface:** A user-friendly GUI for an engaging game experience.
- **Command-Line Interface:** For those who prefer a minimalist approach or want to play in a terminal.
- **Move Validation:** Ensures all moves comply with official chess rules.
- **Check and Checkmate Detection:** Automatically detects check and checkmate situations.
- **Normal Chess:** Allows players to play the game normally.
- **Blind Chess:** Allows players to play the game without the pieces being visible.

## Technologies
- **Python:** The entire game is developed in Python, utilizing object-oriented programming principles.
- **Pygame:** For the GUI version, Pygame is used to handle graphics, game windows, and user interactions.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries support the CLI version.
